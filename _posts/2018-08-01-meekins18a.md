abstract: Machine learning models are increasing in popularity in many domains as
  they are shown to be able to solve difficult problems. However, selecting a model
  to implement when there are various alternatives is a difficult problem. Receiver
  operating characteristic (ROC) curves are useful for selecting binary classification
  models for real world problems. However, ROC curves only consider the misclassification
  cost of the classifier. The total cost of a classification system includes various
  other types of cost including implementation, computation, and feature costs. To
  extend the ROC analysis to include this additional cost information, the ROC Convex
  Hull with Cost (ROCCHC) method is introduced. This method extends the ROC Convex
  Hull (ROCCH) method, which is used to select potentially optimal classifiers in
  the ROC space using misclassification cost, by selecting potentially optimal classifiers
  using this additional cost information. The ROCCHC method is tested using three
  binary classification data sets, each of which include real feature costs as the
  additional cost information. Competing classifiers are created with the CART algorithm
  by using each combination of features or sensors for each data set. The ROCCHC method
  reduces the classifier decision space to 4%, 9%, and 0.02%. These results are compared
  to the current ROCCH method, which misses 91%, 58%, and 6% of potentially optimal
  classifiers because the method does not include the additional cost information.
