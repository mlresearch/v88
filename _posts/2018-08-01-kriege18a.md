abstract: The cuneiform script constitutes one of the earliest systems of writing
  and is realized by wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets. A tremendous number of cuneiform
  tablets have already been discovered and are incrementally digitalized and made
  available to automated processing. As reading cuneiform script is still a manual
  task, we address the real-world application of recognizing cuneiform signs by two
  graph based methods with complementary runtime characteristics. We present a graph
  model for cuneiform signs together with a tailored distance measure based on the
  concept of the graph edit distance. We propose efficient heuristics for its computation
  and demonstrate its effectiveness in classification tasks experimentally. To this
  end, the distance measure is used to implement a nearest neighbor classifier leading
  to a high computational cost for the prediction phase with increasing training set
  size. In order to overcome this issue, we propose to use CNNs adapted to graphs
  as an alternative approach shifting the computational cost to the training phase.
  We demonstrate the practicability of both approaches in an experimental comparison
  regarding runtime and prediction accuracy. Although currently available annotated
  real-world data is still limited, we obtain a high accuracy using CNNs, in particular,
  when the training set is enriched by augmented examples.
