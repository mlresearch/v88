abstract: 'Class imbalance and lack of ground truth are two significant problems in
  modern machine learning research. These problems are especially pressing in operational
  contexts where the total number of data points is extremely large and the cost of
  obtaining labels is very high. In the face of these issues, accurate estimation
  of the performance of a detection or classification system is crucial to inform
  decisions based on the observations. This paper presents a framework for estimating
  performance of a binary classifier in such a context. We focus on the scenario where
  each set of measurements has been reduced to a score, and the operator only investigates
  data when the score exceeds a threshold. The operator is blind to the number of
  missed detections, so performance estimation targets two quantities: recall and
  the derivative of precision with respect to recall. Measuring with respect to error
  in these two metrics, simulations in this context demonstrate that labeling outliers
  not only outperforms random labeling, but often matches performance of an adaptive
  method that attempts to choose the optimal data for labeling. Application to real
  anomaly detection data confirms the utility of the approach, and suggests direction
  for future work.'
